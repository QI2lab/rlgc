# Richardson-Lucy Gradient Consensus
Basic code for Richardson-Lucy (RL) deconvolution, using gradient consensus as a local stopping criterion.
This avoids the artefacts that normally plague RL deconvolutions while still producing high quality results, and obviates the need for user input (i.e. picking an appropriate regulariser, tuning regularisation parameters, etc.).
